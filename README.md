#Let's Get Drunk

###*Web based drinking game. Like Ring of Fire, with less cards.*

####What?

For people who want an organised way to get drunk, without all the mess of playing cards, printing off cards, rolling dice and having action points, etc. You sit in a circle, the game tell you what to do, you do it. It probably involves consuming alcohol.

###Actual Instructions

- Get yourself and all your mates gathered together. Bring drinks.
- Load up the site.
- Put everyone's name in for whos playing.
- Hit "BRING THE MAYHEM" (N.B mayhem not guaranteed)
- Do what the game says to do. Keep hitting next turn. Repeat.

See? Easy.

All the things you have to do involve people drinking. Sometimes players will get "statuses" applied to them. These change how the instructions are carried out. It's up to the person who has the status to remember to enforce it, but when it's their turn, any statuses they have will appear next to their name, as a handy hint.
